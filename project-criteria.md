# Project Criteria

1. Generate plan that follows the best practice for app development
  - Create a story board for the steps we are going to follow in markdwon file
  - Always refer to this stroyboard
  - Create user profiles and user journeys who are going to use our app
2. This is the overall purpose of our app:
  - Distilling information is complex task. It needs to include a good blend of text and beautifully crafted, informative data visualizations.
  - Similar to an executive summary, but as if God himself would have designed it.
  - You will look for the best practices in data visualization and representing complex information as a well-curated blend of text and data
  - Based on these practices you weill create a web app
3. We are going to start with the first use case
  - We will distill information from a pdf that the user uploads
  - You will need to create the steps to best break down this process, but what could work is that user uploads as pdf document, we extract information from it, look for data, extend the data with relevant context, create visualizations and generate an executive summary page.
4. Tech stack
  - You will decide what is the most appropriate technical solution here
  - You can use Svelte as the framework, D3.js for the visualizations
  - We are serving the page from GitHub, through Netlify
  - We are using the pnpm package manager.
