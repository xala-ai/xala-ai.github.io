## Development Approach

We'll follow these best practices:
- Component-based architecture
- Test-driven development
- Iterative user feedback
- Progressive enhancement
- Accessibility-first design
- Performance optimization

We'll begin with a minimum viable product focusing on PDF upload, basic text extraction, simple visualizations, and summary generation. Later iterations will enhance each component with more sophisticated features.
